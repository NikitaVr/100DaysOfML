**Today's Progress**: Setting up PaperSpace with Kaggle tool and getting dataset ready

**Thoughts:** Create a more detailed log with more steps. Keep a location for useful scripts, also keep track of lessons learned.

### Day 0: 18 July, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Looked through the first 2 lessons of course.fast.ao again. Trained fast ai image classifier with unfrozen layers in the net on https://www.kaggle.com/c/plant-seedlings-classification . Got about 93.3% accuracy. 

**Thoughts:** Can probably tune it more and use different sizes to further improve accuracy. This library definitely makes it easy to get good results very fast.

**Link to work:** [Commit](https://github.com/NikitaVr/100DaysOfMLCode/commit/a5458822952a475c1503d3345ab65f3031bf901e), [Commit of Readable Python Code](https://github.com/NikitaVr/100DaysOfMLCode/commit/db206e77ae9ade436ab23f84efc69b7b02f95db9), maybe a good idea to also commit the trained saved model.
